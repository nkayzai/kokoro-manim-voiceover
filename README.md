            voice="af"  # Model files auto-downloaded if missing
        ))

        circle = Circle()
        square = Square().shift(2 * RIGHT)

        with self.voiceover(text="This circle is drawn as I speak.") as tracker:

        with self.voiceover(text="Let's shift it to the left 2 units.") as tracker:
            self.play(circle.animate.shift(2 * LEFT), run_time=tracker.duration)

        with self.voiceover(text="Now, let's transform it into a square.") as tracker:
            self.play(Transform(circle, square), run_time=tracker.duration)
